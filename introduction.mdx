so i found myself making another RAG bot (for the 2342148th time) and meanwhile, explaining to my juniors about why we should use chunking in our RAG bots,
only to realise that i would have to write chunking all over again unless i use the bloated software library X or the extremely feature-less library Y.
_WHY CAN I NOT HAVE SOMETHING JUST RIGHT, UGH?_ 

Can i just install, import and run chunking and not have to worry about dependencies, bloat, speed or other factors?  

Well, with chonkie you can! (chonkie boi is a gud boi)
