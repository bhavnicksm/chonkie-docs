## Availability

Different chunkers are available depending on your installation:

| Chunker | Default | embeddings | 'all' |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| TokenChunker | ✅ | ✅ |  ✅ |
| WordChunker | ✅ | ✅ |  ✅ |
| SentenceChunker | ✅ |  ✅ | ✅ |
| SemanticChunker | ❌ |  ✅ | ✅ |
| SDPMChunker | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Choosing the Right Chunker

Each chunker is designed for specific use cases:

### TokenChunker
- **Best for**: Working with LLMs that have strict token limits
- **Use when**: You need precise control over chunk sizes
- **Advantages**: Fast, consistent chunk sizes
- **Limitations**: May break words/sentences

### WordChunker
- **Best for**: Human-readable output
- **Use when**: Word integrity is important
- **Advantages**: Preserves word boundaries, readable chunks
- **Limitations**: Variable chunk sizes

### SentenceChunker
- **Best for**: Maintaining sentence context
- **Use when**: Complete sentences are important
- **Advantages**: Natural text divisions, preserves sentence meaning
- **Limitations**: Chunk sizes can vary significantly

### SemanticChunker
- **Best for**: Context-aware retrieval
- **Use when**: Topical coherence is crucial
- **Advantages**: Maintains semantic relationships, better for RAG
- **Limitations**: Requires additional dependencies

## Common Interface

All chunkers share a consistent interface:

```python
# Single text chunking
chunks = chunker.chunk(text)

# Batch processing
chunks = chunker.chunk_batch(texts)

# Direct calling
chunks = chunker(text)  # or chunker([text1, text2])
```

## Performance Considerations

- **TokenChunker**: Fastest, ideal for large-scale processing
- **WordChunker**: Fast with additional word boundary checks
- **SentenceChunker**: Moderate speed with sentence parsing
- **SemanticChunker**: Most compute-intensive due to embeddings

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with TokenChunker unless you have specific needs
   - Upgrade to more sophisticated chunkers as needed

2. **Consider Your Use Case**
   - Token limits → TokenChunker
   - Human review → WordChunker
   - Natural language → SentenceChunker
   - Context preservation → SemanticChunker

3. **Test Performance**
   - Try different chunkers on your specific data
   - Monitor chunk sizes and processing times
   - Balance quality vs. speed for your needs

## Example: Comparing Chunkers

```python
from chonkie import TokenChunker, WordChunker, SentenceChunker, SemanticChunker

text = """
Long text that needs to be chunked...
"""

# Compare different chunking strategies
token_chunks = TokenChunker().chunk(text)
word_chunks = WordChunker().chunk(text)
sentence_chunks = SentenceChunker().chunk(text)
semantic_chunks = SemanticChunker().chunk(text)
```

Each chunker will process the same text differently, optimizing for its specific strategy while maintaining Chonkie's core principles of being lightweight and fast.
