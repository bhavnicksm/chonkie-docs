so i found myself making another RAG bot (for the 2342148th time) and meanwhile, explaining to my juniors about why we should use chunking in our RAG bots,
only to realise that i would have to write chunking all over again unless i use the bloated software library X or the extremely feature-less library Y.
_WHY CAN I NOT HAVE SOMETHING JUST RIGHT, UGH?_ 

Can i just install, import and run chunking and not have to worry about dependencies, bloat, speed or other factors?  

Well, with chonkie you can! (chonkie boi is a gud boi)

## Quick Start

Get started with Chonkie in three simple steps: Install, Import and CHONK!

### Installation

```bash
pip install chonkie
```

Want more features? <Tooltip tip="Not recommended for production">Install everything</Tooltip>:
```bash
pip install chonkie[all]
```

<Note>
  Chonkie follows a special approach to dependencies, keeping the base installation lightweight while allowing you to add extra features as and when needed.
  Please check the [Installation](/installation) page for more details.
</Note>

### Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
# First import the chunker you want from Chonkie 
from chonkie import TokenChunker

# Initialize the chunker
chunker = TokenChunker() # defaults to using GPT2 tokenizer

# Here's some text to chunk
text = """
Woah! Chonkie, the chunking library is so cool! I love the tiny hippo hehe.
"""

# Chunk some text
chunks = chunker(text)

# Access chunks
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Chunk: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}")
```
